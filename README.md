# Project2

*Created a abstract method for letterAvg in the MesoAbstrarct


In the PosAvg:
* Used the 'try and catch' to read the file in case there was an error in reading the complier will know.


* Read through the file three times not necessary


* Split the string by tabs and spaces and put them in an array, splitters


* Store the first element of splitters in the docs array.


*Stored and printed the the average values of the station ID chosen (stID-1, stID+1, stID-2, stID+2)


For MesoInherit:
* Sum and average the characters in the station Id chosen by casting into doubles.


* Found the floor, ceiling and average of the character's ascii in int.


* Converted the average into a single character by casting back to char.


For LetterAvg:
* Using the character converted, I run through the whole document to find the total number of station 
Id that start with the same character and returned that sum.


*Stored all those station Id in an array list and returned the array list.


*Printed out the whole array list containing the station is starting with the character found in the MesoInherit.
